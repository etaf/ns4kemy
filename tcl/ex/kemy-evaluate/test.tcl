# Experiments with on-off sources that transmit data for a certain
# "on" time and then are silent for a certain "off" time. The on and # off times come from exponential distributions at specifiable rates.
# During the "on" period, the data isn't sent at a constant bit rate
# as in the existing exponential on-off traffic model in
# tools/expoo.cc but is instead sent according to the underlying
# transport (agent) protocol, such as TCP.  The "off" period is the
# same as in that traffic model.
